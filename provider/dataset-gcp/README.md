# Dataset registry service

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
Pre-requisites

* GCloud SDK with java (latest version)
* JDK 8
* Lombok 1.16 or later
* Maven

### Installation
In order to run the service locally or remotely, you will need to have the following environment variables defined.

| name | value | description | sensitive? | source |
| ---  | ---   | ---         | ---        | ---    |
| `GCP_SCHEMA_API` | ex `https://os-schema-jvmvia5dea-uc.a.run.app/api/schema-service/v1` | Schema API endpoint | no | output of infrastructure deployment |
| `GCP_STORAGE_API` | ex `https://os-storage-jvmvia5dea-uc.a.run.app/api/storage/v2` | Storage API endpoint | no | output of infrastructure deployment |
| `AUTHORIZE_API` | ex `https://os-entitlements-gcp-jvmvia5dea-uc.a.run.app/entitlements/v1` | Entitlements API endpoint | no | output of infrastructure deployment |
| `GCP_FILE_DMS_BUCKET` | ex `file-dms-bucket` | File bucket name postfix (full name represent by project-id + partition-id + GCP_FILE_DMS_BUCKET ex `osdu-cicd-epam-opendes-file-dms-bucket`) | no | output of infrastructure deployment |
| `GCP_EXPIRATION_DAYS` | ex `1` | expiration for signed urls & connection strings | no |  |
| `REDIS_GROUP_HOST` |  ex `127.0.0.1` | Redis host for groups | no | https://console.cloud.google.com/memorystore/redis/instances |

### Run Locally
Check that maven is installed:

```bash
$ mvn --version
Apache Maven 3.6.0
Maven home: /usr/share/maven
Java version: 1.8.0_212, vendor: AdoptOpenJDK, runtime: /usr/lib/jvm/jdk8u212-b04/jre
...
```

You may need to configure access to the remote maven repository that holds the OSDU dependencies. This file should live within `~/.mvn/community-maven.settings.xml`:

```bash
$ cat ~/.m2/settings.xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<settings xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0"
          xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
          xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/settings-1.0.0.xsd">
    <servers>
        <server>
            <id>community-maven-via-private-token</id>
            <!-- Treat this auth token like a password. Do not share it with anyone, including Microsoft support. -->
            <!-- The generated token expires on or before 11/14/2019 -->
             <configuration>
              <httpHeaders>
                  <property>
                      <name>Private-Token</name>
                      <value>${env.COMMUNITY_MAVEN_TOKEN}</value>
                  </property>
              </httpHeaders>
             </configuration>
        </server>
    </servers>
</settings>
```
* Update the Google cloud SDK to the latest version:

```bash
gcloud components update
```
* Set Google Project Id:

```bash
gcloud config set project <YOUR-PROJECT-ID>
```

* Perform a basic authentication in the selected project:

```bash
gcloud auth application-default login
```

* Navigate to Dataset service root folder and run:

```bash
mvn clean install   
```

* If you wish to build the project without running tests

```bash
mvn clean install -DskipTests
```

After configuring your environment as specified above, you can follow these steps to build and run the application. These steps should be invoked from the *repository root.*

```bash
cd provider/dataset-gcp && mvn spring-boot:run
```
## Testing
 
 ### Running E2E Tests 
 This section describes how to run cloud OSDU E2E tests (testing/dataset-test-gcp).
 
 You will need to have the following environment variables defined.
 
 **Entitlements configuration for integration accounts**
 
 Execute following command to build code and run all the integration tests:
 
 ```bash
 # Note: this assumes that the environment variables for integration tests as outlined
 #       above are already exported in your environment.
 # build + install integration test core
 $ (cd testing/dataset-test-core/ && mvn clean install)
 ```
 ```bash
 # build + run GCP integration tests.
 $ (cd testing/dataset-test-gcp/ && mvn clean test)
 ```
