## Delivery Service
The Delivery Service is responsible for authenticating an OSDU user, and, if they have access, returns a signed URL to download the data file.
The Delivery Service is a [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) service.

## Build
All references on repositories settings are external to `pom.xml` and should be configured through Maven `settings.xml` file.
To build against Community GitLab repositories, use `.mvn/community-maven.settings.xml` settings:
`mvn clean compile test --settings .mvn/community-maven.settings.xml`

## Publish
All references on Binary Storage required to publish Maven artifacts are external to `pom.xml` and should be configured through Maven `settings.xml` file.
There are two profiles available in `.mvn/community-maven.settings.xml` that can be used to publish artifacts to Community GitLab:
1. `GitLab-Authenticate-With-Job-Token` - default one, and should be used in CICD pipelines
2. `GitLab-Authenticate-With-Private-Token` -  profile for local development and manual publishing of artifacts. To activate the profile, the developer should have `COMMUNITY_MAVEN_TOKEN` env variable with a configured personal GitLab access token. Please see [GitLab documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html) on how to set-up Personal Access token in GitLab:
```
export COMMUNITY_MAVEN_TOKEN='Your personal GitLab access token'
mvn deploy --settings .mvn/community-maven.settings.xml
```

Apache Maven 3.6.0
Maven home: /usr/share/maven
Java version: 1.8.0_212, vendor: AdoptOpenJDK, runtime: /usr/lib/jvm/jdk8u212-b04/jre
...
```

### Build and run the application

After configuring your environment as specified above, you can follow these steps to build and run the application. These steps should be invoked from the *repository root.*

```bash
# build + test + install core service code
$ mvn clean install --settings .mvn/community-maven.settings.xml

# build + test + package azure service code
$ (cd provider/delivery-azure/ && mvn clean package --settings ../../.mvn/community-maven.settings.xml)

# run service
#
# Note: this assumes that the environment variables for running the service as outlined
#       above are already exported in your environment.
$ java -jar $(find provider/delivery-azure/target/ -name '*-spring-boot.jar')

# Alternately you can run using the Mavan Task
$ mvn spring-boot:run
```

### Test the application

After the service has started it should be accessible via a web browser by visiting [http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html). If the request does not fail, you can then run the integration tests.

```bash
# build + install integration test core
$ (cd testing/delivery-test-core/ && mvn clean install --settings ../../.mvn/community-maven.settings.xml)

# build + run Azure integration tests.
#
# Note: this assumes that the environment variables for integration tests as outlined
#       above are already exported in your environment.
$ (cd testing/delivery-test-azure/ && mvn clean test --settings ../../.mvn/community-maven.settings.xml)

```

In the request body, supply a JSON representation of user object. The following permission is required to call the delivery API.

service.delivery.viewer

## Configuring User Entitlements (Deprecated)

Here is how you can configure user entitlements manually.

 - Identify the correct CosmosDB account. This can be found in the output of the infrastructure template. Alternatively, you should be able to identify it as the singular CosmosDB account that is provisioned in the resource group that hosts the this service
 - Use the `Data Explorer` tool in the CosmosDB UI and navigate to the `UserInfo` container
 - Identify if there already exists a `User` record in the table by applying a filter equal to `WHERE c.id = '$IDENTITY_ID'`. `$IDENTITY_ID` will be one of: (1) Object ID of a user (i.e., `974cb327-1406-76b9-91de-cbd6eb7ec949`) or (2) Application ID of a system assigned identity (i.e., `930b212b-e21f-478f-b993-af9b41abe836`)
 - If the user exists, verify that the permissions are correct. If the user needs to be added to a group, you can edit the document directly and click `Save`
 - If the user does not exist, you can add a document that has the following schema. The exact groups you wish to provision to the user will most likely be different, so be sure to add/remove the appropriate roles. The below listing represents a user with full access to all services.
```json
{
    "id": "$OBJECT_ID",
    "uid": "$IDENTITY_ID",
    "tenants": [
        {
            "name": "$SOME_OSDU_TENANT",
            "groups": [
                "service.delivery.viewer",
                ...
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

## Deploying the Service

Service deployments into Azure are standardized to make the process the same for all services if using ADO and are closely related to the infrastructure deployed. The steps to deploy into Azure can be [found here](https://github.com/azure/osdu-infrastructure)

The default ADO pipeline is /devops/azure-pipelines.yml

### Manual Deployment Steps

__Environment Settings__

The following environment variables are necessary to properly deploy a service to an Azure OSDU Environment.

```bash
# Group Level Variables
export AZURE_TENANT_ID=""
...

# Pipeline Level Variable
export AZURE_SERVICE="entitlements"
export AZURE_BUILD_SUBDIR="."
export AZURE_TEST_SUBDIR="testing"
export AZURE_OSDU_TENANT="opendes"
export AZURE_COMPANY_DOMAIN="contoso.com"
export AZURE_VALID_GROUPNAME="integ.test.data.creator"
export AZURE_INVALID_GROUPNAME="InvalidTestAdmin"

# Required for Azure Deployment
export AZURE_CLIENT_ID="${AZURE_PRINCIPAL_ID}"
export AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET="${AZURE_PRINCIPAL_SECRET}"
export AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP="${AZURE_BASENAME}-osdu-r2-app-rg"
export AZURE_APPSERVICE_PLAN="${AZURE_BASENAME}-osdu-r2-sp"
export AZURE_APPSERVICE_NAME="${AZURE_BASENAME_21}-au-${AZURE_SERVICE}"

# Required for Testing
...
```

__Azure Service Deployment__


1. Deploy the service using the Maven Plugin  _(azure_deploy)_

```bash
cd $AZURE_BUILD_SUBDIR
mvn azure-webapp:deploy \
  -DAZURE_DEPLOY_TENANT=$AZURE_TENANT_ID \
  -Dazure.appservice.subscription=$AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID \
  -DAZURE_DEPLOY_CLIENT_ID=$AZURE_CLIENT_ID \
  -DAZURE_DEPLOY_CLIENT_SECRET=$AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET \
  -Dazure.appservice.resourcegroup=$AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP \
  -Dazure.appservice.plan=$AZURE_APPSERVICE_PLAN \
  -Dazure.appservice.appname=$AZURE_APPSERVICE_NAME
```

2. Configure the Web App to start the SpringBoot Application _(azure_config)_


```bash
az login --service-principal -u $AZURE_CLIENT_ID -p $AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET --tenant $AZURE_TENANT_ID

# Set the JAR FILE as required
TARGET=$(find ./target/ -name '*.jar')
JAR_FILE=${TARGET##*/}

JAVA_COMMAND="java -jar /home/site/wwwroot/${JAR_FILE}"
JSON_TEMPLATE='{"appCommandLine":"%s"}'
JSON_FILE="config.json"
echo $(printf "$JSON_TEMPLATE" "$JAVA_COMMAND") > $JSON_FILE

az webapp config set --resource-group $AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP --name $AZURE_APPSERVICE_NAME --generic-configurations @$JSON_FILE
```

3. Execute the Integration Tests against the Service Deployment _(azure_test)_


```bash
mvn clean test --settings .mvn/community-maven.settings.xml -f $AZURE_TEST_SUBDIR/pom.xml
```
