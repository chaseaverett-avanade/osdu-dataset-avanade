## Build
All references on repositories settings are external to `pom.xml` and should be configured through Manve `settings.xml` file.
To build against Community GitLab repositories, use `.mvn/community-maven.settings.xml` settings:
`mvn clean compile test --settings .mvn/community-maven.settings.xml`

## Publish
All references on Binary Storage required to publish Maven artifacts are external to `pom.xml` and should be configured through Maven `settings.xml` file.
There are two profiles available in `.mvn/community-maven.settings.xml` that can be used to publish artifacts to Community GitLab:
1. `GitLab-Authenticate-With-Job-Token` - default one, and should be used in CICD pipelines
2. `GitLab-Authenticate-With-Private-Token` -  profile for local development and manual publishing of artifacts. To activate the profile, the developer should have `COMMUNITY_MAVEN_TOKEN` env variable with a configured personal GitLab access token. Please see [GitLab documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html) on how to set-up Personal Access token in GitLab:
```
export COMMUNITY_MAVEN_TOKEN='Your personal GitLab access token'
mvn clean compile --settings .mvn/community-maven.settings.xml
